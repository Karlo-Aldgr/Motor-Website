            <p>
                The engine is the power plant of the motorcycle. It converts fuel into mechanical energy to propel
                the bike forward. Motorcycle engines come in various types, including inline, V-twin, and parallel-twin.

            <p>
                The frame is the structural foundation of the motorcycle. It provides support for the engine, wheels,
                and other components. Frames are often made from steel, aluminum, or a combination of materials.

            <p>
                The suspension system consists of front forks and rear shocks that absorb bumps and ensure a smooth
                ride. It contributes to the motorcycle's handling and stability.

            <img src="Motor.Picture/CafeRacer4.jpg" alt="Motorcycle Wheels and Tires">
            <p>
                The wheels, along with the tires, are crucial for the motorcycle's movement. They provide traction
                and stability on the road. Motorcycles can have different wheel sizes and tire types based on their
                intended use.
