        <h2>What are Cafe Racers?</h2>
        <p>
            Cafe racers are a style of motorcycles that originated in the 1960s in the UK. These bikes are known for
            their minimalist design, low-slung handlebars, and a streamlined, vintage look. Cafe racers were popularized
            by riders who modified their motorcycles for improved speed and handling, often racing between cafes.

        <p>
            The cafe racer culture is deeply rooted in the rebellious spirit of the 1960s. Riders would customize their
            motorcycles for better speed and maneuverability, then gather at cafes to showcase their bikes and engage in
            impromptu races. Today, cafe racers remain an iconic symbol of style, freedom, and the joy of riding.
